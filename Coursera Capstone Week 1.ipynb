Around each of these brewery locations, a main source of revenue for ABC is selling their beer to local bars in the near vicinity of the brewery. \n\nABC is planning on starting their expansion across the country by adding 1 more location outside of the East Coast. They have done a variety of market research, and have narrowed their options down to Dallas, TX and Boise, ID. \n\nThe executives of ABC Breweries would like to learn more about how important the \"bar scene\" is to each of these cities. They want to make sure to pick a city where an adequate portion of the most popular destinations are bars. This will help them be confident that the bars that they are selling their beer to will continue to thrive (and continue to purchase their beer), due to being in a generally favorable environment for bar owners.\n\nThey've also found that they generally sell more beer to the bars that are closest in proximity to their East Coast locations, so whichever city they choose, they want to make sure to build their brewery in a location that is reasonably close to some of the most popular bars.\n\nAs data scientists, our job is to help the stakeholders (ABC's executives) use data to compare whether Dallas or Boise may have an environment that is more favorable for bars, and therefore for ABC's continued revenue growth. We also want to show them where some of the most popular bars are, so that they can best choose a specific location to have their brewery."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\n\nTo solve this problem for the stakeholders, we will be relying on Foursquare location data and other geospatial data. We will need to make separate calls to the Foursquare API: one set of calls for Dallas's data, and another set of calls for Boise's data. \n\nWe will be using Foursquare's \"Explore\" endpoint to find 100 recommended venues in the vicinity of Dallas, and will do the same for Boise.\n\nThis data will need to be cleaned and formatted appropriately in a more digestable dataframe in order to better interpret it and eventually report back to the executives.\n\nFor each city, we will hone in on the Categories of the 100 recommended venues (e.g. Bar, Hotel, Park, etc).\n\nWe will want to filter the Dallas and Boise dataframes down to only show the venues with a Category including the word \"bar\". We want to make sure this includes \"Hotel Bars\", \"Dive Bars\", and so on, in addition to strictly \"Bars\".\n\nThese filtered results, compared to the original list of 100 recommended venues, will show us the proportion of recommended venues in the city that are \"bars\" of some sort.\n\nWe can then compare the proportion in Dallas vs the proportion in Boise and report back to the stakeholders with the city that seems to have a more favorable environment for bars.\n\nFinally, for each of the cities, we'd like to visualize our filtered results by plotting each of the top recommended bars onto a map, so that the stakeholders can determine the ideal spot to have the newest location of ABC Breweries."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
